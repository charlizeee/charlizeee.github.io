                    FAVORITE CMSC SUBJECT
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the number of CMSC subjects that I have taken in the past years, 
                    <br>
                    CMSC 123 has become the subject I have come to love the most. As
                    <br>
                    a batch 2020 student, I was not able to start my Computer Science 
                    <br>
                    career in a face-to-face setting. The unfortunate circumstances at that 
                    <br>
                    time forced all students, including myself, to learn behind computer 
                    <br>
                    screens. That kind of set-up is not by any means ideal for a technical 
                    <br>
                    course like computer science. As our circumstances as a society got 
                    <br>
                    better, I finally had the chance to take a CMSC course face-to-face. It 
                    <br>
                    has honestly been very difficult. But, to my surprise, I was able to learn
                    <br> 
                    more and appreciate the art of my course in a better sense.

                    <br>
                    C would have to be my favorite so far.
                    <br>
                    I believe that C was the programming language that allowed me to 
                    <br>
                    really learn and ascertain myself in this field.

                    During my free time, I usually just play an array of games. This includes Valorant, 
                    <br>
                    Genshin Impact, and Cookie Run Kingdom. These games 
                    <br>
                    take up a big chunk of my free time and allow me to destress.

                    <br>
                    As one of the Universitys goals is to create holistic individuals, GE 
                    <br>
                    courses arguably has equal importance to once major subjects. One 
                    <br>
                    particular GE course has allowed me to understand and define my 
                    <br>
                    experience in this society. This course happens to be SAS 1. The 
                    <br>
                    lessons in this course may seem mundane but it ultimately thought me 
                    <br>
                    a lot of things about myself and other people. It allowed me to 
                    <br>
                    understand how much society can contribute to the way I think and 
                    <br>
                    how it penetrates through my morals.

                    Like any other Filipino, my favorite dish happens to be adobo. 
                    <br>
                    Something about this dish really just makes me want to eat.

                    CHILDHOOD DREAM
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I was an elementary student, I used to want to be a teacher. I 
                    <br>
                    adored my teachers who I spent all day with learning a lot of different
                    <br> 
                    things. The way they handled our class and the way they were able to 
                    <br>
                    patiently teach was one of the primary reasons it became my dream 
                    <br>
                    for a very long time.
